You will need to get the latest binary build of lambdas to make this work (check the accept license box!) 
   http://jdk8.java.net/lambda/

Then hack setvars.bat file in this dir to point to your installation. All other bat files use this so you should
only have to hack one. 

Then 
  build.bat

and
  run <sample>

Where <sample> is one of 
  Mandel
  Squares
