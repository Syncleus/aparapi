#summary How to build the NBody example.

=*Building NBody*=
The NBody example is located in the/ examples subdirectory under the Aparapi trunk:  

{{{
    trunk/
       ...
       examples/
         ...
         nbody/
            src/java/com.amd.aparapi.nbody/
            build.xml
            nbody.sh
            nbody.bat

}}}

The NBody example requires a little more work to build because it depends on a third party project named ‘JOGL’.

JOGL is a set of OpenGL™ bindings for Java® and the NBody example uses this library to render the particles/bodies (potentially many thousands of them) at runtime.  More information about JOGL can be found here http://jogamp.org/jogl/www.

The {{{build.xml}}} file {{{build}}} target will download the jars required to build and run the nbody example if the files do not exist.


To build nbody, perform the following commands.

{{{
C:> ant clean build
}}}

The NBody build.xml file includes a ‘run’ target so you can launch the application using.

{{{
C:> ant run
}}}

Or if you prefer to launch from either the nbody.sh or nbody.bat script.

For Linux® we also need to chmod nbody.sh in order to execute it.
{{{
chmod +x nbody.sh
}}}

The nbody scripts take the execution mode as the first argument, the number of bodies as the second argument, and then the height and width (in pixels).

Windows example:
{{{
C:> nbody  GPU 32768 800 800 
}}} 

Linux example:
{{{
$ ./nbody.sh  GPU 32768 800 800 
}}}
